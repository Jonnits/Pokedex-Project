## About This Application

This application presents an interactive index of the original 150 Pokemon. It allows the user to peruse a list of all 150 first generation Pokemon and select each individually. Selected Pokemon display a modal with the Pokemon's name, height, abilities and image.

## How to Run This Application

This application is simple to run. Load the page to see the list of Pokemon buttons and click each button to load a modal with the Pokemon's image, name, height and abilities displayed. To exit the modal, you can either click the 'Close' button, the 'X' in the corner of the modal, the 'Esc' key on your keypad, or clicking the mouse outside of the modal.
You cannot switch between Pokemon's modals. Please close your current modal before opening another.
